                  Ask anybody who’s struggling with dieting and exercise and they’ll invariably tell you things like “I need more motivation”, “dieting isn’t fun, I just don’t get excited about it”, or the worst is “When I open that fridge that’s it there is no going back”. We at the Compuskills development team are here for you, we’re creating an app that’s going to revolutionize dieting and exercise and enable you to finally meet your goals.
